## Overview :
"rd_wr.c" is a low-level C program designed for memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) communication, primarily interfacing with JTAG and APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) registers. It enables register-based read/write operations using mapped memory and bit-field structured data.


## Compilation :
To compile the program, use:
     gcc -o rd_wr rd_wr.c 
This generates an executable named rd_wr.

## Usage :
Once compiled, the program can be executed with the appropriate parameters.Run the compiled executable with necessary permissions:
    ./rd_wr <read_write_flag> <addr> <data>  

<read_write_flag>: Specifies the operation type (0 for read, 1 for write).
<addr>: The memory-mapped register address (must be valid).
<data>: The data to be written (only required for write operations).

  ##To read from a register:
    ./rd_wr 0 <addr>

  ##To write to a register:
    ./rd_wr 1 <addr> <data>

<addr> should be a valid memory-mapped register address, and <data> is required only for write operations.


## Error Handling
If permission errors occur, try running:
   sudo ./rd_wr <read_write_flag> <addr> <data>
