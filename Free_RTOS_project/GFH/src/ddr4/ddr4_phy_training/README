Introduction:
	This directory contains the C code for a generic DDR4 PHY training sequence. The sequence is designed to configure the DDR4 PHY registers based on various parameters such as DRAM frequency, DIMM type, DFI ratio, and other configurations.

Features:
	* Dynamic Configuration: The register writes are generated dynamically based on the given variables, ensuring that the PHY configuration matches the specific DRAM setup.
	
	* Versatile Support: Supports different DRAM frequencies, DIMM types (x8 or x4), and configurations for multiple chip select (cs_dimm0).

Parameters:
	The main parameters influencing the DDR4 PHY training sequence are:

	* dram_freq: Specifies the DRAM frequency.
	* dimm_type: Specifies whether the DIMM is x8 or x4.
	* dfi_freq_ratio: Specifies the DFI ratio.
	* cs_dimm0: Specifies the chip select configuration for the first DIMM.
	* rank_num: Specifies the number of ranks.
	* ad_mirror: Specifies the address mirroring configuration.
	* skip_training: Specifies whether to skip the training process.

The PHY training sequence is divided into the following parts:

	* phy config: Part of the Hex.
	* skip training: Part of the Hex.
	* imem init: Part of the Flash.
	* dmem init: Part of the Hex.
	* phy init Engine: Part of the Hex.

Conclusion:
	This generic PHY sequence generator for DDR4 PHY ensures that you can generate the necessary register writes for any given configuration. This helps in streamlining the DDR4 PHY training process, making it adaptable to different DRAM setups.
