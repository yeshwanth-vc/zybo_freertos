## GFH

##Introduction
 
  In this project, there are source and header files for DDR4, D2D, and I3C. These are intended to be loaded onto the Zybo board via JTAG.

##Prerequisites

  Install the ARM toolchain (required to build the firmware)and XSDB Tool:

Command:

	sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

##Building the ELF:

  Navigate to the MKB project directory and run:

  	cd GFH
  	make

 This will generate the ELF file: <name>.elf

#Flashing to Zybo:

 Use XSDB or XSCT to load the ELF file onto the Zybo board:

  	./xsdb
	connect
	targets
	stop
	dow <path to .elf>
	con

 Make sure the board is connected via JTAG before flashing.

#Serial Output

 You can view UART output using tools like:
    • PuTTY
    • Gtkterm
    • screen

 Example using screen:
  screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200

  The serial output starts after the ELF is successfully loaded.

#Error Handling

    • Toolchain not found
 Ensure that gcc-arm-none-eabi is correctly installed and available in your PATH. use this command to check the arm-toolchain.
                           
Command:
 	arm-none-eabi-gcc --version

If not found, re-install:
   sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
